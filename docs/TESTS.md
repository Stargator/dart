# Running the Tests

Choose your operating system:

* [Windows](#windows)
* [Mac OS X](#mac-os-x)
* [Linux](#linux)

# Windows

1. Open a Command Prompt.

2. Get the first exercise:

   ```batchfile
   exercism fetch dart

   Not Submitted:     1 problem
   dart (Hello World) C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\dart\hello-world

   New:               1 problem
   dart (Hello World) C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\dart\hello-world

   unchanged: 0, updated: 0, new: 1
   ```

3. Change directory into the exercism:

   ```batchfile
   C:\Users\JohnDoe>cd C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\dart\hello-world
   ```

4. Download the dependent packages:

   ```batchfile
   C:\Users\JohnDoe>pub get
   ```

5. Run the tests:

   ```batchfile
   C:\Users\JohnDoe>pub run test
   ```
   *(Don't worry about the tests failing, at first, this is how you begin each exercise.)*

6. Solve the exercise.  Find and work through the `README.md` guide ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/exercism/dart/blob/master/exercises/hello-world/README.md)).


Good luck!  Have fun!
